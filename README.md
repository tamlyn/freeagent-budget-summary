## FreeAgent Budget Summary

This is the repository for the FreeAgent Budget Summary graph by [Outlandish](http://outlandish.com)

### Limitations

The chart is not shown if the project does not have a budget or billing rate set. Also, if the budget is set in days rather than hours or pounds, the chart is not shown as it is not possible to convert days into hours without knowing the length of a working day (i.e. 7, 7.5 or 8 hours).

Billable and unbillable hours are counted together.
